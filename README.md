# IAED-Project-2024
This is my project for my class called Artificial Intelligence

This project's statement is here > [Projeto_IA_2023_24_PIPES_23abril.pdf](Projeto_IA_2023_24_PIPES_23abril.pdf)

There's 9 available tests of input in [test pipe 1-9](test pipe 1-9) and another 9 in [test pipe 10x10-50x50](test pipe 10x10-50x50), so you can test your code you should run [run_tests.py](run_tests.py).

My project is all in [pipe.py](pipe.py), and it returns the expected output on almost all the tests in the folders and 14/15 on the private tests (couldn't get the last one because of the time limit exceeded, since I still get into a loop that I don't know about).

There's also a [Visualizer](Visualizer) that let's you see the program running with all the pieces, I didn't bother to try it out since we didn't have much time to spare to do so, so if you want to try it and find how to run it, there it is.

Also, there's an image that I drew so I would know how I would flip the pieces on the sides so that I could narrow their available actions.
